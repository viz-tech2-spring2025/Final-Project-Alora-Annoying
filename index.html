        <h2>The Growing Footprint of Extreme Weather</h2>
        <p>
          In recent decades, extreme weather events have become increasingly frequent, affecting regions across the
          globe. Before we explore how ecosystems are adapting (or failing to adapt), we must first understand the scale
          of the disruption from human’s perspective.

            Nature is in flux, and not in the way it should be. The rhythm of life—when animals migrate, when plants
            bloom, when food sources are available—is changing in unpredictable ways. Extreme weather events, from
            heatwaves to hurricanes, are forcing ecosystems to adapt in real-time.

          An Overlooked Crisis: How Scientists Are Trying to Keep Up

          Recognizing this blind spot, a group of researchers systematically reviewed over 300 studies on how EWEs
          affect wildlife and plants. Their work spans 2001 to 2017, revealing a growing awareness of these ecosystem
          impacts.The number of articles recorded over the years is presented.

          Overall, the increasing number of ecosystem impacts of extreme weather events being surveyed is partly a sign
          of the growing attention of scholars in this issue, but it does not diminish the ecosystem impacts caused by
          extreme weather events.

          Resilience: How Species Respond to Natural Disasters
        </h2>

        <p>
          However, not all species succumb to extreme weather in the same way. Some have evolved survival strategies
          that help them withstand or even thrive in the face of disasters. This is where compensation types—mechanisms
          of resilience—come into play.

            As we witness how species respond to the chaos of nature, we are reminded that resilience takes many forms. Some adapt, some retreat, some transform. In their quiet endurance, there is a message for us, too. How will we respond—not just to the storms around us, but to the disruptions within our shared world? Perhaps, in the strategies of nature, we might find the seeds of our own survival, and a deeper understanding of what it means to live in balance with the Earth.
